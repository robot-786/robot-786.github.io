                                    We respect user privacy and comply with all applicable data‐protection laws (e.g. GDPR in the EU/UK, CCPA in California) when handling personal data. <em>Personal data</em> is defined broadly as any information related to an identified or identifiable person. For example, GDPR explicitly cites names, addresses and phone numbers as personal data. Consequently, our service only collects the minimal information needed for each function (the principle of data minimisation). In a restaurant-order bot scenario we may collect a customer's name, address, and phone number; in a clinic appointment bot we would also collect age and insurance details (the latter being health-related "sensitive" data); and in an e-commerce support bot we might additionally collect order numbers or purchase details. We collect these details only as required to perform the service (e.g. to book a table, schedule an appointment, or process an order) and we do <em>not</em> harvest or store any data outside the scope of providing the service.
                                </p>

                                    We follow GDPR's mandate that data be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary" for the purpose. We do not keep unnecessary fields just in case. For instance, if a clinic partner requires your insurance to book an appointment, we collect it; if not, we do not request it.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    We use personal data only to provide the service and (when requested) to share with our client companies (e.g. the restaurant, clinic, or retailer). We do not sell user data. Any sharing with third parties is strictly on an as-needed basis. Our contracts with service providers (e.g. OpenAI for language processing, DeepGram for transcription, Twilio for SMS, Calendly for scheduling, or Google Sheets for data logging) specify that those providers act only as processors under our instruction. For example, DeepGram's privacy policy notes that customer data is processed only on the controller's instructions. Likewise, Twilio states it uses binding corporate rules to protect data "regardless of [its] origin or destination". We recommend users also review the privacy terms of these providers, as they each maintain robust security and confidentiality measures.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    We retain personal data only as long as needed for the service. In accordance with GDPR's "storage limitation" principle, we keep data no longer than necessary. For example, if you place a restaurant order, we hold your details to communicate with the restaurant and, if authorized, for possible future re-orders; once your order is complete (or after any retention period set by the restaurant), we delete or anonymize the data. Similarly, booking or appointment data is deleted after the appointment or as required by the client company.

                                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    We implement appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect data. Under GDPR Article 32, a controller must apply "appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk". We follow this by using industry-standard encryption for data in transit and at rest, access controls, secure servers, regular security audits, and staff training. Only authorized personnel and contracted processors can access personal data, and we train them to handle data confidentially.

                                    We honor user rights under all applicable laws. Under EU/UK GDPR, individuals have rights to access their data, receive information about how it is used, correct errors, erase data ("right to be forgotten"), restrict or object to processing, and obtain a copy of their data (data portability). Under the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act, the same rights apply. Under the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA, amending CCPA), Californians additionally have rights to know what categories of personal information we collect and why, to delete their information, to correct inaccuracies, to opt out of any sale/sharing of their data, and to limit use of sensitive information. We will respond promptly to any verified request to exercise these rights (e.g. providing or deleting your data) as required by law. We will also give notice of any privacy practices at the time of data collection, and we will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.

                                    Because we operate internationally (US, UK, EU), our policy is written as a <em>global privacy policy</em> covering all jurisdictions. It includes our lawful basis for processing, the types of personal data collected, purposes of processing, sharing practices, security measures, and user rights in clear language. We comply with GDPR (EU/UK), CCPA/CPRA (California), and any other relevant regional laws. For California residents, note that their rights under CCPA supplement the above. For EU/UK residents, GDPR grants extensive protections (personal data must be processed transparently, for a specific purpose, and with security safeguards). We are not formally licensed or regulated as a medical or legal entity, so if our service is used in a healthcare or legal context, we will make clear we do not provide professional advice (see Terms below).

We do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. We expressly disclaim any warranty of accuracy or fitness for a particular purpose.

Our total liability (if any) for direct damages is limited to the amount you have paid us (if applicable) or USD $100, whichever is greater.
